      portrait, name, and base statistics: financial standing, and academic aptitude."

  - message: "These base statistics will affect our school\u2019s overall financial
      and academic performance scores, which are indicated on the right-hand side
      of the screen. The degree to which they are affected may change from day-to-day,

  - message: The scholarship fund situated between the financial and academic scores
      is expended whenever a student without a full finance bar is admitted to Uncommon
      Academy. Unless the bar is completely full, they will not be able to attend
      the academy out of pocket.

  - message: Keep an eye on your scholarship fund, because it will deplete quickly,
      and eventually be diminished. Financially unstable students cannot be accepted
      when the scholarship fund is insufficient.
